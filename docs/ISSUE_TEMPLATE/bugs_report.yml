        1. Add the mod [Plugin Info](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1302). It will write to the log details on which mods are loaded and if there were any issues loading them.
        2. Edit your `BepInEx.cfg` file. Find the `[Logging.Disk]` section and set `LogLevels = All`
        3. Run the game and reproduce the bug.
        4. Upload/attach your `LogOutput.log` file that contains the error. It can be found at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\LogOutput.log`
