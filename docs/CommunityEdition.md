# Statement for Governing Community Standards in Developing Community Edition Versions of Valheim mods.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment within our community-driven projects. The development of Community Edition versions of Valheim mods is guided by a set of community standards that promote mutual respect, open collaboration, and the shared goal of creating valuable and accessible software for all. These standards serve as the foundation for interaction and development within our community, ensuring a positive and productive experience for all contributors and users.

Conflicts should be resolved through open dialogue and compromise, with the ultimate goal of moving the project forward.

All contributions must adhere to the project's chosen open-source licenses, and contributors should ensure that they have the right to submit code and content. Proper attribution and copyright notices must be maintained.

1. **Maintenance and Support**: The responsibility of maintaining and supporting Community Edition versions is a shared endeavor. Contributors are encouraged to provide assistance, answer queries, and engage in ongoing support discussions.
1. **Continuous Improvement**: Our community standards are not static; they evolve with the community's needs. Regular review and refinement of these standards help us adapt to changing circumstances and ensure a vibrant, respectful, and productive community.
